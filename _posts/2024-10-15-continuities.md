 Absolutely continuity is particularly useful in statistics because any function that is absolute continuous must be differentiable almost everywhere and satisfies the fundamental theorem of calculus. As a result, any random variable that has an absolute continuous density function will be a continuous random variable. 

There are various types of continuties and their relative restrictivenesses vary.
Below summarizes this relationship.

$$
\text{lipschitz cont.}\subseteq\text{absolute cont.}\subseteq \text{uniformly cont.} \subseteq \text{continuous}
$$

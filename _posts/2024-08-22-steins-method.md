Stein's method is a way to show that a random variable $$W$$ has a distribution is close to a target distribution (usually the normal distribution). Its idea is that if two random variables are similar, then the expectations of some functions of the two random variables being compared should be similar.


Let $$Z$$ be a standard normally distrbuted random variable and let $$\mathscr{C}$$ be the set of continuous and piecewise continuously differentiable functions $$f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ with $$E\lvert f'(Z)\rvert<\infty$$.

excerpt: 'vce_mcov is an eclass command that can be used after running reg. It replaces the entries of the variance matrix (stored in e(V)) relating to user-chosen parameter(s) of inferential interest with the Leave-Cluster-Out-Crossfit (LCOC) estimates (see Anatolyev and Ng, 2024). All postestimation commands will work as usual.'
